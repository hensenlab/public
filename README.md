# Hensen lab code
Repository of Python code developed in the Hensen lab at Leiden University, The Netherlands

This currently contains 
- some python instrument drivers/wrappers.
- some examples of our measurement tools based on earlier work by many others.
- some other useful tools such as an ArXiv crawler and a script that converts Mathematica expressions into python expressions.

Make sure to add the base folder (the folder where you find this file) to sys.path for imports to work.
